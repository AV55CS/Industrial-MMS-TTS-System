## Project Overview

This system aims to address communication challenges in multilingual industrial environments through AI-powered voice synthesis. The current implementation focuses on Hindi and English language support with intelligent text processing capabilities.

### Current Features

- **Bilingual Support**: Hindi and English text-to-speech conversion
- **Number Processing**: Basic conversion of digits, currency, and time formats to spoken words
- **Language Detection**: Automatic identification of Hindi vs English text
- **Message Classification**: Categorization of safety, urgent, instruction, and information messages
- **Voice Effects**: Audio modifications based on message type
- **Web Interface**: Dark-themed Gradio interface for user interaction

### Technical Implementation

The system integrates multiple AI models in a processing pipeline:

| Component | Model | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **TTS Engine** | `facebook/mms-tts-hin`, `facebook/mms-tts-eng` | Voice synthesis |
| **Language Detection** | `papluca/xlm-roberta-base-language-detection` | Text language identification |
| **Text Processing** | `microsoft/DialoGPT-medium` | Number-to-words conversion |
| **Classification** | `facebook/bart-large-mnli` | Message type categorization |

## Installation

### System Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- 4GB+ RAM for model loading
- Internet connection for initial model download

### Setup Process
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Industrial-MMS-TTS-System.git
cd Industrial-MMS-TTS-System

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download AI models
python scripts/setup_models.py

# Run application
python src/main.py
```

### Access
Open browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:7863`

## Current Capabilities

### Text Processing
- Converts basic numbers to words (e.g., "1234" ‚Üí "one thousand two hundred thirty four")
- Handles currency formats (e.g., "‚Çπ50,000" ‚Üí "fifty thousand rupees")
- Processes time formats (e.g., "12:30" ‚Üí "twelve thirty")

### Voice Generation
- Hindi and English speech synthesis using Facebook MMS models
- Volume adjustments based on message classification
- Repetition for safety and urgent messages

### User Interface
- Clean, dark-themed web interface
- Real-time processing feedback
- Sample text library for testing
- Auto-detection with manual override options

## Development Status

### Completed Components
- ‚úÖ Basic TTS functionality for Hindi and English
- ‚úÖ HuggingFace model integration
- ‚úÖ Number-to-words conversion framework
- ‚úÖ Web interface with Gradio
- ‚úÖ Voice effect implementation

### In Progress
- [ ] Improved number conversion accuracy
- [ ] Better mixed-language text handling
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Error handling improvements

### Planned Features

## Known Limitations

### Current Scope
- Limited to Hindi and English languages
- Processing time varies (2-4 seconds per request)
- Number conversion works best with common formats
- Memory usage requires 2GB+ RAM for optimal performance

### Technical Constraints
- Large model files require significant disk space
- Initial model loading takes time
- Best performance on multi-core processors
- Internet required for first-time setup
